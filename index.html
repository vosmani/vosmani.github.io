<p>
I am Professor of Clinical AI and Machine Learning at Queen Mary University of London. I direct the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/research/teams/">Osmani Lab</a> within Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI). 
</p>

<p>
I am also a Visiting Professor at the University of Sheffield where I was the director of a 40-member Health Informatics Research Group, an Executive Board member of the Healthy Lifespan Flagship Institute (HELSI) and a Research Board member of the Insigneo Institute. I also co-directed a Doctoral Training Centre on Public Health, funded by Wellcome.
</p>

<p>
My interdisciplinary <a href="publications.html">research</a> focuses on analysis of large-scale, longitudinal health records, including biomarkers, imaging, multi-omics, and routine care data to optimise treatment strategies, improve patient care and mitigate health inequities. Apart from clinical data, I also work on incorporating human behaviour data, such as those generated from wearable devices and smartphones, with a particular focus on mental health.

<br>
Methodological aspects of my research include generative architectures, such as GANs VAEs, and Diffusion Models, for synthetic (artificial) patient data, explainable AI methods and sample complexity.

<br>The overarching objective of my research is to integrate predictive modelling at the bedside and bring the acquired evidence back, in a continuously improving feedback loop, consequently establishing a learning digital health system.
</p>


<p>
I lead and participate in several <a href="projects.html">projects</a> where some of my work has been featured in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/10/12/72283/how-your-smartphone-can-detect-bipolar-disorder/">MIT Technology Review</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/11931244/Your-smartphone-can-detect-bipolar-disorder.html">The Telegraph</a>, <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2016/08/24/32001-20160824ARTFIG00245-peut-on-reperer-une-personne-depressive-grace-a-ses-photos-instagram.php">Le Figaro</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/04/25/saving-time-and-health-leveraging-technology-to-improve-the-healthcare-industry">Forbes</a>, and other media outlets.

<br>My group collaborates with some of the leading clinical institutions, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org">Mayo Clinic</a> (FL), <a href="https://www.clevelandclinic.org/">Cleveland Clinic</a> (OH), <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org">Mount Sinai Hospital</a> (NY), <a href="https://www.gosh.nhs.uk">Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children</a>, as well as several leading research institutions.
</p>

<p>
I supervise a number of PhD and Masters <a href="students.html">students</a> and hold the Italian National Scientific Habilitation (ASN).
</p>

<p>
Previously I was a tenured Senior Researcher in Digital Health Centre at
 <a href="https://www.fbk.eu">Fondazione Bruno Kessler</a> research institute, Italy, where I led a group of researchers and students in tackling clinical challenges through machine learning methods.
I was also a lecturer in the department of <a href="https://www.cogsci.unitn.it">Psychology and Cognitive Science</a> at the University of Trento, Italy and CREATE-NET research centre.</p>

<p>
During 2009, I was a visiting researcher at <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>, USA. I finished my PhD at <a href="https://waltoninstitute.ie/">Walton Institute</a>, South East Technological University, Ireland. My PhD was funded by the <a href="https://www.sfi.ie/">Science Foundation Ireland</a>, during which I was a visiting research student at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg">Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R)</a> in Singapore.
</p>

<p>
My sister, Dr. Qendresa Osmani is also a scientist at Medicines Research Centre, <a href="https://www.gsk.com/">GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) </a> pharmaceutical company, UK.
